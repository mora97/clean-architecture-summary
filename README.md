*this is a summary of clean-architecture in Persian language*

if you don't know Persian you can use this summary: [https://github.com/serodriguez68/clean-architecture](https://github.com/serodriguez68/clean-architecture)

also you can watch this [video](https://youtu.be/sn0aFEMVTpA) to learn clean architecture, in this video Uncle Bob himself is the presenter

I try to summarize this valuable book that has been written by *Robert C. Martin* in **Persian** language clearly, but i doubt that i translate and summarize it very well. if you found any mistake or even it could be written better, please do below steps:

- do your changes
- submit changes on new branch

thanks :)
